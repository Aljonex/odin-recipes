This is a project for making a recipes website during the odin project using pure html.
By the end of this project I will have demonstrated:
- Absolute and relative linking with a competent file structure
- Recipes with images and instructions
    - This will make use of differing types of lists
    
Food included:
- Lasagna
- Poverty Stew
